    text={[<h3>Summer 2020</h3>, <p>Betelhem led a series of sexual health and reproductive health workshops for Ethiopian and Eritrean girls and young women as an intern with Celia Thomas who was a Health Educator working at Seattle & King County Public Health Department. Within these series, topics such as sex, contraceptive health, rape culture, gender and sexual health identity, among others, were discussed within the context of the Eritrean and Ethiopian communities. Eledon, Amra, and Betelhem met during these conversations.</p>, <h3>September 2020</h3>, <p>OUR POWERS was launched when Eledon reached out to Betelhem wanting to continue and expand the series. Eledon wanted to make it reach more young women and girls with these conversations. This started the process of formalizing the workshops to include guest speakers and an official website. Amra joined and supported the planning a few months later as she was also passionate about women and girl’s health.</p>]}

    text="Hello, my name is Eledon Shimelis Beyene and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I wanted to launch the OUR POWERS workshop because I found participating in the prior summer workshop was helpful and healing. It was the first time in my life I was able to hear from peers with similar backgrounds about sexuality, contraceptive methods, gender norms, parental and societal expectations, rape culture, and women’s rights. It was liberating to know other peers with shared experiences. Unfortunately, the workshop was a one time offer but I found it critical to expand on its conversations. I reached out to Betelhem Muno, in hopes of working with her to establish the workshop for another summer."

    text="Hi everyone! My name is Amra Endenat Zegeye and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I am from the DC metro area and I am currently a junior in college getting a B.S. in Biology and Health Studies. Summer of 2020 was when I first talked about sexual and mental health in an Ethiopian/Eritrean cultural context in a similar workshop. The enlightening discussions provided even more meaning and outlets for healing than I had previously been aware of. I enjoyed how different the space was compared to any other workshop catered towards the same topics because I truly felt we understood each other more. As the year went on, Betelhem Muno reached out to me to work with her and Eledon Beyene on OUR POWERS in the hopes that we can provide these safe spaces for other girls to talk about their own experiences in a cultural context and know they are not alone."

    text="My name is Betelhem Muno, and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am 21 years old, and a junior in college. I am getting my B.S. in Environmental Studies and Health Studies. I am a part of the OUR POWERS because I want to create a space to have honest conversations about sexual health within our (Ethiopian and Eritrean) communities as that is something that I’ve heard is wanted and needed from many of my friends and family. I am passionate about health, empowerment, having agency, and structural change, and I hope OUR POWERS can be a space that starts these conversations."
